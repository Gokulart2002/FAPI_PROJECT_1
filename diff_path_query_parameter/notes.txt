when coming to path parameter we need to pass every path , then only we can access our output 
but if you use query parameter , that one doesn't need every path we only base path , after that we will pass query what are thinks we needed
ex :
from fastapi import FastAPI

app=FastAPI()

database={
    "key1":"value1",
    "key2":"value2",
    "key3":"value3"
          }


@app.get("/sub/{sub_page}/{query}")
async def subpage(sub_page:str,query:int):
    return database.get(sub_page)

when you access to output , we need write hole path like :http://127.0.0.1:8000/sub/key1/5  

but if use query parameter we doesn't need write hold path and here we can able pass defaulf values also 
but path parameter we can't access default thinks it doesn't support.

ex :
from fastapi import FastAPI

app=FastAPI()

database={
    "key1":"value1",
    "key2":"value2",
    "key3":"value3"
          }


@app.get("/sub")
async def subpage(sub_page:str="key1",query:int=5):
    return database.get(sub_page)

here if i doesn't give sub_page and query aslo ,it will work use of default value,
but path _parameter doesn't work here we need pass sun_page ,query is in the path

url like:http://127.0.0.1:8000/sub
